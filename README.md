Revive adserver plugin need specific formate for files and folder. I have create dummy
hW ( hello world ) plugin for revive adserver to understand what structure require in a
plugin.

Here is the file/folder structure which require:

  plugins/
  plugins/api/
  plugins/api/hW/
  plugins/api/hW/helloWorld.class.php
  plugins/etc/
  plugins/etc/hW/
  plugins/etc/hW/hW.xml
  plugins/etc/hW.xml

And above plugin folder should be in zip formate ( hW.zip )
You can downlaod this test plugin from from which I keep in this repo : hW.zip
